How much do they love socialising?â€¨
By BabeMagnet69
An Original Song
They get on with life as a pilot,
They're a smelly kinda type.
They like breeding guppies and racing snails.
They like to contemplate studying.
But when they start to daydream,
Their mind turns straight to socialising.

Tralala tralala... 

Sometimes I look at them and I look into their eyes,
I notice the way they think about socialising with a smile,
Curved lips they just can't disguise.
But they think it's studying making their life worthwhile.
Why is it so hard for them to decide which they love more?
Studying or...
Socialising?They like to use words like 'spiffing' and 'disgusting.'
They like to use words about studying.
But when they stop their talking,
Their mind turns straight to socialising.

Tralala tralala... 

Sometimes I look at them and I look into their eyes,
I notice the way they think about socialising with a smile,
Curved lips they just can't disguise.
But they think it's studying making their life worthwhile.
Why is it so hard for them to decide which they love more?
Studying or...
Socialising?They like to hang out with John and Mike.
But when left alone,
Their mind turns straight to socialising.

Tralala tralala... 

Sometimes I look at them and I look into their eyes,
I notice the way they think about socialising with a smile,
Curved lips they just can't disguise.
But they think it's studying making their life worthwhile.
Why is it so hard for them to decide which they love more?
Studying or...
Socialising?They hate wasp nests and people putting DVDs back in the wrong boxes.
But they just think back to socialising,
And they're happy once again.

Tralala tralala...
