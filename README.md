### IntelligentMusic
This project aims to make a Python web application that generates computer-designed music that evolves over time, using Genetic Programming (for the evolution, check out [DarwinTunes](http://darwintunes.org), a university project). 

Machine learning, perhaps using Google's TensorFlow is going to be used for **automatic deduction of user's likeability; music element and song quality.**

Moderate music theory will be employed to generate the chords, so that it will not be a "random" noisy chord to begin with. To my knowledge, computer music generation has already been made, however, user's input are still needed. There exists no A.I. that "knows" whether a person would like a music or not.

This has applications in biophysics and psychology of musical perception too.

Please do not hesitate to contact me for any queries. I will appreciate input or constructive critisms and coaching too. I also have a [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/crispynugget/), where you can find out about all the sector's and involvements that I have partaken in before.
