### IntelligentMusic
Makeing a Python web application that generates computer-designed music that evolves over time, using gnetic Programming (for the evolution, check out DarwinTunes, a university project). Machine learning, perhaps using Google's TensorFlow is going to be used for automatic deduction of user's likeability; music element and song quality.
